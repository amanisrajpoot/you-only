## Quick Deployment Commands

### Backend (Railway)
```bash
cd backend-express
railway login
railway up
```

### Shop (Vercel)
```bash
cd shop
vercel --prod
```

### Admin (Vercel)
```bash
cd admin/rest
vercel --prod
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Railway
railway rollback

# Vercel
vercel rollback

# Docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build <old-version>
```

### Gradual Rollback
